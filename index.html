  <h1>Hello! Check out some cool places to visit!</h1>
  <p>Here's a list of all the <b>super cool</b> places I would like to visit.</p>
  <p>Here's a list of the places I would like to visit, from where I want to visit most to least.</p>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Nassau.</b></li>
  <li><b>Ireland.</b></li>
  <li><b>Iceland.</b></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Let's check out the reasons why I'd like to visit these places.</h2>
  <h3>Nassau.</h3>
    <p><b>Nassau</b> was the base for <b>PIRATES</b> back in the day. That's <s>super cool</s>, no strike that, it's SUPER AWESOME!</p>
    <p>They even have museums about Pirates.</p>
    <p>If you have not watched <em><b>Black Sails</b></em> yet, you should.</p>

  <h3>Ireland.</h3>
  <p>It's beautiful there. Also, they know how to get their drink on! <br> I also did a <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23 and Me</a> and it says I have a lot of Irish in me, maybe I should trace this stuff back and find me a castle. </p>

  <h3>Iceland.</h3>
    <p>So even though I'd be scared doing this, I would like to check out a few ice caves.<br> (If I am being honest it will probably one ice cave before I chicken out on the rest but thats ok haha.) <br> Also, <strong>Faeries</strong> could totally live here!</p>
